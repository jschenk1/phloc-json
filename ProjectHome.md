This basic library provides an easy-to-use abstraction layer around Codehaus Jackson.

Depends on [phloc-commons](http://code.google.com/p/phloc-commons).

Rough ChangeLog:
  * v2.4.0: Added new domain model in package com.phloc.json2 for easier usage
  * v2.2.0: Updated to Jackson 2.0.0
  * v2.1.7: Updated to Jackson 1.9.6
